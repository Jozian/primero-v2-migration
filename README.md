These Scripts are for migrating a v1.7 system to a v2 system
=============================================================


Configuration
==================
- Run ruby_config_exporter.rb on the 1.7 to generate v2 compatible ruby config seeds.
- Copy the generated seeds to a config repo branch
- Add in the load_configuration.rb script to the config repo branch
- Deploy that confiuration to the v2 server


Data Migration
